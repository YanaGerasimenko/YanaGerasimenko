I am Yana Gerasimenko, now only a middle school student. But I'm in my way to become a real developer and programmer. So now I'm still learning and practicing in diffrent majorites like Cyber Security, Web Developing, Robotics developing and etc.
#
Iâ€™m currently working on SDUMM (Multifunctional Manipulator Remote Control System), it's a underwater robotic system (I will have special repository for this, but later).
Also I'm practicing my skills in Python language. And started participate in different CTFs.
#
I'm looking to collaborate on Cyber Security projects and collaborations for CTF's
