# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
## :shipit: About me: :rainbow:

I am Yana Gerasimenko, now only a middle school student. But I'm in my way to become a real developer and programmer. So now I'm still learning and practicing in diffrent majorites like Cyber Security, Web Developing, Robotics and etc.

Iâ€™m currently working on SDUMM (Multifunctional Manipulator Remote Control System), it's a underwater robotic (I will have special repository for this, but later).

Also I'm practicing my skills in Yandex Lyceum (place for studying Python language). It's a course with more than 500 tasks in one year.
